                       is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Having no knowledge on either .NET or C#, I started my journey here with lots of positivity and enthusiasm and currently dealing with the most important tasks everyday. I started off with small CSS modifications, and surprised my seniors by mastering the Google Maps API which gave them confidence to give me the serious stuff. I went on to do the front end for &#39;Click and Collect&#39; and integrate a real-time quick search engine. Currently working on an online payment gateway for the company. </h5>

                     <p>Discovering that I loved Web Development, I decided to get serious and joined General Assmbly to upskill myself with the latest technologies. I had learnt HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby on Rails, React, NodeJS, SASS, Bootstrap and almost every other technology.  I had the freedom to explore different frameworks and text editors here and I have done projects that were interactive. One of my projects included voice to text conversion which I used for building a childrens&#39; game online. Yet another time, I used the Face Recognition API to use fun filters and generate different effects in photos. </p>
